A very basic blog site, implemented for practicing microservices and related concepts.

Concepts implemented (working list):
  1. Async communication between microservices using event bus.
  2. Containerization of services (using Docker)
  3. Orchestration of services, i.e intracluster communication with ClusterIP and load balancing with nginx (using Kubernetes)
